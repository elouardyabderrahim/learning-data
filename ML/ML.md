# Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:

---

## 1. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning focuses on training an agent to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. 

**Examples**:
- A robot deciding its path to reach a destination.
- A chess engine determining the next optimal move.  

This approach is widely used in **game theory**, robotics, and autonomous systems.

## 2. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model learns from a labeled dataset, where each input has a corresponding output (target variable). The goal is to predict the target variable for new, unseen data.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Target Variable (Labels)**: The output we want the model to predict.
- **Observations**: Rows or examples in the dataset, representing the instances the model learns from.
- **Features**: Columns or attributes that provide input information to help predict the target.

**Workflow**:
1. Provide a dataset with input features and corresponding target labels (training data).
2. Train the model to learn patterns from the data.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen inputs.

**Examples**:
- Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

## 3. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the model works with an unlabeled dataset. The goal is to identify patterns, structures, or groupings in the data without predefined labels.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Clustering**: Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying data while preserving important features (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).

**Examples**:
- Grouping customers with similar purchasing behavior.
- Detecting anomalies in network traffic for cybersecurity.

## Supervised Learning:

### Types of Supervised Learning Tasks:

1. **Classification**:
   - **Definition**: Assigns a category or class label to the input data.
   - **Examples**:
     - Email classification: Spam or Not Spam.
     - Image classification: Recognizing cats, dogs, or other animals in photos.
     - Sentiment analysis: Classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.

2. **Regression**:
   - **Definition**: Assigns a continuous value as the output, often used for predicting quantities.
   - **Examples**:
     - Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
     - Estimating a person’s weight based on height and age.
     - Forecasting stock prices or sales numbers.


## Unsupervised Learning:

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from unlabeled data. There is no target column or guide to indicate the desired output. Instead, the model analyzes the dataset and identifies patterns, structures, or relationships within the data.  

Unlike supervised learning, the model doesn't explain why it clusters data or chooses specific patterns—it's up to us to interpret the results and extract meaningful insights.  

### Key Applications of Unsupervised Learning:  

#### 1. **Clustering**:
   Clustering models group similar observations together based on patterns in the data.  
   - **Models**:
     - **K-Means**:
       - Requires specifying the number of clusters beforehand.
       - Example: Segmenting customers into groups based on purchasing behavior.  
     - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:
       - Does not require specifying the number of clusters but needs the minimum number of observations and a distance parameter to form a cluster.
       - Example: Identifying geographical regions of interest in spatial data.  

#### 2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Used for identifying data points that deviate significantly from the normal pattern or distribution.
   - **Examples**:
     - Detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets.
     - Identifying sensor malfunctions in IoT devices.

#### 3. **Association**:
   - Focuses on discovering relationships or associations between observations.
   - **Example**: 
     - Market Basket Analysis:
       - Understanding which products are frequently purchased together in retail (e.g., "If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter").  
       - This can help design better marketing strategies or product recommendations.

## Evaluating Performance

### Classification

#### Overfitting
Overfitting occurs when a model performs very well on the training data but poorly on the testing data. This is problematic because it indicates that the model has memorized the training set rather than learning patterns that generalize to new data.

**How to measure a model's performance:**

1. **Accuracy**  
   Accuracy is the proportion of correctly predicted observations out of the total observations.  
   \[
   \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}}
   \]  

   **Limitations of Accuracy**  
   Consider a fraud detection example where only 7 out of 100 transactions are fraudulent. A model that classifies all transactions as legitimate would achieve 93.33% accuracy but would fail to identify any fraudulent transactions. This highlights the importance of using additional metrics.

2. **Confusion Matrix**  
   A confusion matrix provides detailed insights into the classification performance by showing the counts of:  
   - **True Positives (TP):** Fraudulent transactions correctly classified as fraudulent. (Like a working smoke alarm when there is smoke.)  
   - **False Negatives (FN):** Fraudulent transactions incorrectly classified as legitimate. (Like a smoke alarm failing to detect smoke.)  
   - **True Negatives (TN):** Legitimate transactions correctly classified as legitimate.  
   - **False Positives (FP):** Legitimate transactions incorrectly classified as fraudulent.

3. **Sensitivity (Recall)**  
   Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.  
   
   \[
   \text{Sensitivity (Recall)} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Negatives (FN)}}
   \]

4. **Specificity**

   Specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified.

    \[
   \text{Specificity} = \frac{\text{True Negatives (TN)}}{\text{True Negatives (TN)} + \text{False Positives (FP)}}
   \]

   These metrics are particularly useful in imbalanced datasets where the minority class (e.g., fraudulent transactions) is of primary interest.

### Evaluating Regression

In regression problems, performance is evaluated by measuring the error between the predicted values and the actual values. Several common error metrics include:  

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
   The average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values. 

   \[
   \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |\hat{y}_i - y_i|
   \]

2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  
   The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.  

   \[
   \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
   \]

3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**  
   The square root of MSE, providing error in the same units as the output variable. 

   \[
   \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}
   \]

4. **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):**  

   Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

   \[
   R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)}}{\text{Total Sum of Squares (SST)}}
   \]

### Evaluating Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning lacks predefined target variables, making evaluation more subjective and dependent on the task. Common evaluation methods include:

1. **Clustering Metrics:**
   - **Silhouette Score:** Measures how similar an object is to its cluster compared to other clusters.  
   - **Davies-Bouldin Index:** Evaluates the compactness and separation of clusters.  

2. **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
   - Visual inspection of reduced dimensions (e.g.,PCA or t-SNE) to assess meaningful patterns.

3. **Reconstruction Error:**  
   In methods like autoencoders, the difference between input and reconstructed data can indicate performance.

4. **Domain-Specific Evaluation:**  
   Metrics tailored to specific tasks, such as anomaly detection precision in fraud detection or clustering validity in image segmentation.
